    """Get glottal open quotient from electroglottography data
    
    Extract fundamental frequency of voice (f0) and glottal open quotient (OQ) 
    at equally spaced intervals in a recording of electroglottography (a stereo 
    file).  OQ is calcuated with the 'hybrid' method (Herbst, 2020). Preprocessing 
    filtering method follows Rothenberg (2002).

    Parameters
    ==========
        
        sig : string
            path to a two channel audio file with EGG data in one of the channels
        egg_channel : int, default = 1
            audio channel (0 or 1) where EGG signal will be found
        hop_dur : float, default = 0.005
            interval in seconds between frames (0.005 seconds = 5 milliseconds)
        min_f0 : int, default = 60
            minimum possible F0 (in Hz)
        max_f0 : int, default = 400
            maximum possible F0 (in Hz)
        hp_cut : int, default = 70 
            highpass filter cut frequency (in Hz) (Rothenberg, 2002)
        hp_order : int, default = 8
            highpass filter order (Rothenberg, 2002)
        threshold : float, default = 0.43
            threshold between 0 and 1, on the EGG signal for glottal opening instant (Herbst, 2020)
        
    Returns
    =======
        df : DataFrame
            Open quotient and f0 results in a Pandas dataframe.

    Note
    ====
        The returned Pandas dataframe has columns:
        
            * sec - midpoint times (seconds) of the analysis frames in f0 and OQ
            * OQ - the glottal open quotient as a function of time.
            * f0 - estimates of the fundamental frequency of voicing as a function of time

    Example
    =======
    >>> eggfile = "F1_bha24_1.wav"  # a stereo file with audio in 0 and egg in 1
    >>> oqdf = phon.egg2oq(eggfile,egg_channel=1)  # return open quotient data
